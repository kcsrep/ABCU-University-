What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
This project solves the issue of storing course iformation and read and import data from a file. The projects sort the courses and sort the course alphanumerically. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by breakingdown the project into smaller more manageable steps. I also implemented testing every few lines of code to ensure my code was outputting the desired results. Data structures are important to understand becuase it allows us to organize and format the data. Data structures can also help us understand how effecient an algorithm is and if it should be implemented in to the program.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcam the roadblocks by looking back at my notes or checking zybooks, and giving myself a couple of mins of downtime away from the computer to try and get a new perspective. Typicaly walking away and coming back to it helps with any mental roadblocks.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Before this  project, I had no experience using algorithms, and i also have never considered the run time of my programs. After this project, I plan on taking my time to understand the data structures that i can use in my system and try to implement them if it improves the runtime of my program. I also believe this will also allow me to better analyze problems and find a solution faster.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My work on this project has evolved the way i write programs that are maintainable, redable, and adaptable, by providing organized ways to store, manage, and manipulate data efficiently. Making complex data handling simpler and more understandable. Additionally, using the right data structure enhances performance and reduces errors, leading to more efficient and scalable code.
